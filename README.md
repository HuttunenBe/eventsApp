# 🌟 Events App – Highlight Events 

This web app started as a team project at Business College Helsinki. I decided to finish it on my own, keeping the parts I built and adding new features myself. The app is about discovering and managing local events all around Finland.
Users can explore, add, edit and delete events, with all changes saved to a database. It has several other features like dark mode, weather info, maps for event locations, a "read more" toggle, emoji icons for event types, calendar view and multiple ways to search or sort events.
